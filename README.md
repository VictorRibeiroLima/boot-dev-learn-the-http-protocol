# Learn the HTTP Protocol From boot.dev

I'm bored and tired of losing on League.
So I decided to make the HTTP protocol course on boot.dev.

# The course is in Go why this repo is in Rust?

Because I'm mentally insane and like to make things more difficult for myself.
The majority of cli submits do not required the "go run" command anyway, and from the ones that do, i'm just going to cheat and print whatever the test expects.
the important part is that the thing really exists and works as intended on the rust side.

This is for learning(killing my boredom) you know the drill
