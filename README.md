# Learn the HTTP Protocol From boot.dev

I'm bored and tired of losing on League.
So I decided to make the HTTP protocol course on boot.dev.

# The course is in Go why this repo is in Rust?

Because I'm mentally insane and like to make things more difficult for myself.
The majority of cli submits do not required the "go run" command anyway, and from the ones that do, i'm going to make some hacky solution to pass on it.

This is for learning(killing my boredom) you know the drill
